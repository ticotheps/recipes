Ingredients:
  -2 slices of whole wheat bread (any type will work)
  -2 tablespoons of creamy JIF peanut butter (any kind will work)
  -2 tablespoons of Smuckers Strawberry Preserves

Directions:
  1. Use a butter knife to spread 1 tablespoon of peanut butter on to 1 slice of
  bread.

  2. Repeat step 1 for the other slice of bread using the remaining tablespoon
  of peanut butter.

  3. Use the same butter knife to spread 1 tablespoon of strawberry preserves on
  top of the already existing peanut butter for each slice of bread.

  4. Place one slice of bread on top of the other so that the sides with the
  strawberry preserves meet, with the edges of the bread lining up nicely.

  5. Enjoy your PB & J sandwich! :)
